          Pitch Battles is a desktop web application designed as a training tool for musicians to practice and learn reading pitches. It was designed specifically with young musicians in mind as a way to keep this learning process fun and engaging. I worked with Kevin Simpson and Haley Jacobs, two developers in the front-end program, to create Pitch Battles. My job as the lone back-end developer involved building out a seperate back-end application for handling data, authorization, and post-game analysis.
